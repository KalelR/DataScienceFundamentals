# Data Science Fundamentals
My study into fundamentals of Data Science using python, with numpy, matplotlib, pandas and scikitlearn. 

So far I've covered:
* 1 - Basic regression techniques
    * 1.1 - Simple Linear Regression - Done 
    * 1.2 - Multilinear Regression - Done
    * 1.3 - Polynomial Regression - Done
    * 1.4 - kNN - Done
* 2 - Basic classification techniques
    * 2.1 - Classification & Binary Logistic Regression - Done
    * 2.2 - Logistic Regression 3+ classes - Todo
    * 2.3 - Classification with kNN - Done
* 3 - Model training and validation
    * 3.1 - Dealing with missing variables 
    * 3.1 - Accuracy and precision quantifiers 
    * 3.2 - Model selection: Splitting dataset into training, validation, and test
    * 3.3 - Imputing
    * 3.4 - Being careful with the data: avoid collinearity, feature scaling, multicollinearity
    * Standardizing https://machinelearningcompass.com/dataset_optimization/standardization/
    * 3.5 feature importance graph
    * 3.6 - Regularized Linear Regression - LASSO and RIDGE; gradient descent
    * Regularized Logistic Regression
    * ROC curves



Learning stuff I want to include:
* Pandas:
    * Cleaning data
    * Comparisons of merge types
    
Bigger projects I want to include:
