    "A good model must balance both:\n",
    "- accurate: predictions close to the real values (low error),\n",

    "Accuracy can typically be increased by increasing model complexity (e.g. adding lots of additional parameters) but that can come with a cost of decreasing the precision - complex models tend to specify to the specific datasets they are trained on. They focus on specific but meaningless patterns in the dataset and not on the general patterns (*overfitting*).\n",
    "On the other hand, very small complexity may mean the model is not able to capture the patterns in the data, leading to *underfitting*. \n",

    "![](images/underfitting-overfitting.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of accuracy is usually called bias, and the inverse of precision called variance.\n",

    "## Model selection\n",
    "Our goal is thus to identifying an accurate model that is generalizable (not overfitted). We must thus:\n",
    "1. Define accuracy measures\n",
    "2. Implement techniques that minimize overfitting:\n",
