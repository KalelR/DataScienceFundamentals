# DataScienceFundamentals
My study into fundamentals of Data Science using python, with numpy, matplotlib, pandas and scikitlearn. 

So far I've covered:
* 1 - Basic regression techniques
    * 1.1 - Simple Linear Regression - Done 
    * 1.2 - Multilinear Regression - Done
    * 1.3 - Polynomial Regression - Done
    * 1.4 - Advanced Linear Regression - LASSO and RIdge
    * 1.5 - Simple Logistic Regression
    * 1.6 - Advanced Logistic Regression
    * 1.7 - kNN
* 2 - Basic classification techniques
* 
* 2 - Model training and validation
    * 2.1 - Accuracy and precision quantifiers 
    * 2.2 - Splitting dataset into training, validation, and test
    * 2.3 - Imputing
    * 2.4 - Being careful with the data: avoid collinearity
    * Dummy variables?


Learning stuff I want to include:
* Pandas:
    * Cleaning data
    * Comparisons of merge types
    
Bigger projects I want to include:
